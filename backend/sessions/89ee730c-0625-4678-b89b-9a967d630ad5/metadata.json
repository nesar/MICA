  "summary": "# MICA Comprehensive Analysis Report\n## US Domestic Rare Earth Element Production Capacity Assessment\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Domestic Production vs. Import Dependency**: The U.S. maintains **100% domestic mining capacity** through Mountain Pass mine (~40,000 MT REO annually), but remains **74-80% dependent on Chinese imports** for separated rare earth products and **95-100% dependent** for heavy rare earth elements and finished magnets due to limited downstream proces"
