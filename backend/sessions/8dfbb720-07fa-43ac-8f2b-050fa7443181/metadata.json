  "summary": "# MICA Analysis Report: U.S. Domestic Rare Earth Production Capacity\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Minimal Current Production**: The United States currently has **only one operational rare earth mine** at Mountain Pass, California, operated by MP Materials. This facility produces rare earth concentrates but has limited downstream processing capability, making the U.S. heavily dependent on China for refined rare earth materials and magnets.\n\n2. **Significant Capacity Expansion Un"
