  "reasoning": "# Analysis Plan for Ambiguous \"approve\" Query\n\n## Current Situation Assessment\n\nThe query \"approve\" lacks sufficient context to proceed with substantive critical materials analysis. The preliminary research correctly identifies this as an incomplete or ambiguous request that requires clarification before meaningful work can begin.\n\n## Analysis Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Contextual Discovery and Clarification\n\n**Step 1: Search for Recent Approval-Related Critical Materials Activities**\n- **Tool**: web_search\n- **Specific Inputs**: \n  - Search terms: \"critical materials approval pending 2024\"\n  - Search terms: \"Defense Production Act Title III approval process\"\n  - Search terms: \"DOE critical materials funding approval\"\n  - Search terms: \"strategic mineral reserve approval\"\n- **Expected Output**: List of recent projects, initiatives, or policies awaiting approval in the critical materials domain\n- **Rationale**: Determine if there's a current, high-profile approval decision in progress that the user may be referencing\n\n**Step 2: Review Recent Federal Critical Materials Policy Documents**\n- **Tool**: web_search\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Search terms: \"USGS critical minerals list 2024 approval\"\n  - Search terms: \"critical materials supply chain executive order\"\n  - Search terms: \"IRA critical minerals guidance approval\"\n- **Expected Output**: Recent policy documents or regulatory changes requiring approval or recently approved\n- **Rationale**: Identify if user is referencing a specific policy approval process\n\n**Step 3: Check for Pending Procurement or Investment Decisions**\n- **Tool**: web_search\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Search terms: \"DOD critical materials procurement approval FY2024\"\n  - Search terms: \"Inflation Reduction Act critical minerals project approval\"\n  - Search terms: \"CHIPS Act materials supply chain funding approval\"\n- **Expected Output**: Information on pending funding decisions or procurement approvals\n- **Rationale**: Determine if there's a specific investment requiring approval\n\n### Phase 2: Conditional Analysis Pathways\n\n**Step 4A: IF Step 1-3 Identify a Specific Approval Context**\n- **Tool**: web_search + pdf_rag\n- **Specific Inputs**: \n  - Targeted searches on the identified topic\n  - Retrieve relevant policy documents, project proposals, or technical assessments\n- **Expected Output**: Comprehensive background on the specific approval matter\n- **Next Action**: Proceed to Step 5\n\n**Step 4B: IF No Clear Context Emerges**\n- **Tool**: doc_generator\n- **Specific Inputs**: \n  - Summary of search results from Steps 1-3\n  - Request for user clarification with specific examples based on findings\n- **Expected Output**: Structured clarification request document identifying:\n  1. Most likely approval scenarios in current critical materials landscape\n  2. Specific questions to narrow the scope\n  3. Template for user to provide necessary context\n- **Next Action**: Await user clarification\n\n### Phase 3: Structured Approval Analysis (Conditional on Context)\n\n**Step 5: Develop Approval Decision Framework**\n- **Tool**: web_search + pdf_rag\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Relevant statutory requirements for the identified approval type\n  - Historical precedents for similar approvals\n  - Standard evaluation criteria (technical, economic, strategic)\n- **Expected Output**: Decision framework matrix with evaluation criteria\n- **Rationale**: Establish objective basis for approval recommendation\n\n**Step 6: Gather Supporting Data**\n- **Tool**: excel_handler + web_search\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Market data for relevant critical materials\n  - Supply chain vulnerability assessments\n  - Cost-benefit data\n  - Technical feasibility indicators\n- **Expected Output**: Quantitative dataset supporting approval analysis\n- **Rationale**: Provide evidence-based foundation for recommendation\n\n**Step 7: Risk and Impact Assessment**\n- **Tool**: code_agent\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Data from Step 6\n  - Risk factors (geopolitical, technical, financial)\n  - Impact metrics (supply security, economic, strategic)\n- **Expected Output**: \n  - Risk assessment visualization\n  - Impact analysis charts\n  - Sensitivity analysis results\n- **Rationale**: Quantify risks and benefits of approval decision\n\n**Step 8: Supply Chain Simulation (if applicable)**\n- **Tool**: simulation\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - Baseline supply chain configuration\n  - Proposed changes if approval granted\n  - Disruption scenarios\n- **Expected Output**: Comparative resilience metrics showing impact of approval\n- **Rationale**: Model real-world effects of approval decision\n\n**Step 9: Generate Approval Recommendation Report**\n- **Tool**: doc_generator\n- **Specific Inputs**:\n  - All outputs from Steps 5-8\n  - Decision framework\n  - Supporting evidence\n  - Risk/benefit analysis\n- **Expected Output**: Comprehensive approval recommendation document including:\n  1. Executive summary with clear recommendation\n  2. Technical analysis\n  3. Risk assessment\n  4. Financial implications\n  5. Strategic considerations\n  6. Implementation timeline (if approved)\n  7. Monitoring and evaluation plan\n- **Rationale**: Provide decision-maker with complete information package\n\n## Immediate Recommended Action\n\n**Execute Steps 1-3 immediately** to attempt context discovery. Based on results:\n\n- **If context found**: Proceed with Steps 4A through 9\n- **If no context found**: Execute Step 4B and generate clarification request\n\n## Estimated Resource Requirements\n\n- **If clarification needed**: 30 minutes (Steps 1-4B)\n- **If full approval analysis required**: 3-4 hours (Steps 1-9)\n- **Token budget allocation**: \n  - Discovery phase: ~50,000 tokens\n  - Full analysis phase: ~150,000 tokens\n\n## Decision Point\n\n**Should I proceed with Steps 1-3 to attempt context discovery, or would you prefer to provide clarification directly?**",
