## What MICA Does

MICA acts as a knowledgeable research agent that can:

- **Search and analyze** documents, scientific reports, and authoritative web sources. 
- **Process and understand** PDF reports, Excel spreadsheets, and data files
- **Generate insights** through data analysis and visualization
- **Produce professional reports** with proper citations and references

MICA helps you find answers faster while keeping you in control while researching rare earth element supply chains, analyzing mineral production trends, or investigating trade patterns.

## How It Works

### 1. Ask Your Question
Start by asking MICA any question about critical materials. Simple question, for instance:
- *"What are the current supply risks for lithium?"*
- *"How has cobalt production changed over the past decade?"*
- *"What federal policies address critical mineral supply chains?"*

Simple queries can be answered with the backend LLM alone. MICA can handle complex queries with a full agentic workflow. 

### 2. Review the Plan
For complex questions, MICA creates an analysis plan outlining the steps it will take. You review and approve this plan before any analysis begins, ensuring the approach aligns with your needs.

### 3. Watch the Analysis Unfold
MICA executes the approved plan, searching relevant sources, analyzing documents, and processing data. You can follow along as the analysis progresses.

### 4. Receive Your Results
MICA delivers a comprehensive summary with:
- Key findings and insights
- Supporting evidence and citations
- Data visualizations when relevant
- A PDF report

### 5. Ask Follow-Up Questions
Ask follow-up questions, request deeper analysis, or explore related topics. MICA remembers the context of your session.

## Key Features

### Human-in-the-Loop Design
MICA keeps humans in control. You approve analysis plans before execution and can guide the research direction at any point. This ensures the AI works *with* you, not *for* you.

### Trusted Sources
MICA prioritizes authoritative sources including USGS mineral commodity reports, DOE assessments, documents, and peer-reviewed research.

### Local Document Analysis
Upload your own PDFs and data files. MICA can search and analyze your private document collections alongside public sources.

### Data Analysis & Visualization
Beyond text analysis, MICA can process spreadsheets, perform statistical analysis, and generate charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.

### Professional Reports
Every analysis session can produce a formatted PDF report suitable for sharing with stakeholders, complete with executive summary, findings, and references.
